# Open Resource Discovery Specification

![Open Resource Discovery Logo](./static/img/open-resource-discovery-logo-wide.png "Open Resource Discovery Logo")

## Summary

Open Resource Discovery (ORD) is a protocol that **allows applications and services to self-describe their exposed resources and capabilities**.
It can be used to describe static documentation, but can also reflect tenant specific configuration and extensions (at run-time).​

**To learn more, have a look at the [Open Resource Discovery Specification](https://open-resource-discovery.github.io/specification/) documentation.**

> ℹ ORD is an open standard by SAP, currently geared towards the SAP ecosystem.
> However, it is built to be a generic standard and could be used outside of SAP, if the infrastructure (aggregators, namespace registry) is built or adjusted.
> The standard is extensible through extensibility attributes, custom types and policy levels.

## Communication, Feedback & FAQ

If you have feedback, questions or problems, please create a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/open-resource-discovery/specification/issues).

## Ownership and Governance

The ORD standard is governed by the [Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/) / [NeoNephos](https://neonephos.org/projects/open-resource-discovery-ord/), a neutral nonprofit organization that supports the development of open-source projects and standards. See [ORD steering committee](https://github.com/open-resource-discovery/steering#readme).
