Open Resource Discovery (ORD) is a protocol for application / service metadata publishing and discovery and can be used as a foundation for **metadata catalogs and marketplaces** and to improve automation and quality of integrations.

ORD is designed to be **general-purpose** and to work with a wide variety of industry-standard protocols and metadata standards.
It can be used for **static documentation** or to describe the **run-time system landscape**, reflecting tenant specific configuration and extensions.

It is possible to describe [APIs](./spec-v1/interfaces/document#api-resource), [Events](./spec-v1/interfaces/document#event-resource) and higher-level concepts like [Entity Types](./spec-v1/interfaces/document#entity-type) (Domain / Business Objects) and [Data Products](./spec-v1/concepts/data-product.md).
The [Integration Dependencies](./spec-v1/interfaces/document#integration-dependency) describe the use of external resources.
In case that the standardized concepts or attributes are not sufficient, there are extensibility attributes and [Capabilities](./spec-v1/interfaces/document#capability).
All of the described artifacts can share relationships, taxonomy and [grouping](./spec-v1/concepts/grouping-and-bundling.md) concepts, enabling a **well-connected metadata graph**.

ORD can describe **[static](./spec-v1/index.md#def-static-perspective) documentation** (like API / data catalogs and marketplaces) or a **[dynamic](./spec-v1/index.md#def-dynamic-perspective) run-time system landscape** (with tenant specific configuration and extensions).

</div></div></div></div>

Technically, ORD allows applications and services to **self-describe** their resources and capabilities (e.g. ports and adapters).
To adopt ORD, an application implements a read-only entry point ([Service Provider Interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_provider_interface)) that can be used to discover and crawl relevant metadata.

> â„¹ The ORD standard is governed by the [Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/) / [NeoNephos](https://neonephos.org/projects/open-resource-discovery-ord/), a neutral nonprofit organization that supports the development of open-source projects and standards. See [ORD steering committee](https://github.com/open-resource-discovery/steering#readme).

> The ORD interface (JSON Schema) and TypeScript types are available via npm: [`@sap/open-resource-discovery`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sap/open-resource-discovery).

## Use Cases

Information expressed or discovered through ORD can be used to build static **metadata catalogs** or do detailed **runtime inspection of actual system landscapes**.
Based on this, many end-user use cases can be realized, e.g.:

- API and event catalog
- Data product directory/catalog
- Landscape specific API/event discovery for development platforms, platform engineering and low-code/no-code development
- Support admins in configuring services (discovery & automation)
- AI grounding & training
- Generic channel to describe, discover and exchange system capabilities between providers and consumers (even across vendors)

## Goals

<div className="container"><div className="row"><div className="col">
<div className="card"><div className="card__header">
<h3>Design Goals</h3>
</div><div className="card__body"><p>

- Systems to **describe themselves** with a single entry-point to crawl all relevant metadata
- Achieve a combined, machine-readable **system landscape metadata view**
- Enable **fully automatic** of publication and discovery of metadata
- Having **one aligned standard** for
  - Description of different types of resources
  - Description of both the static / generic perspective and the actual runtime perspective
  - Support of many different metadata-driven use-cases and consumer requirements
- ORD is an **open standard**
  - It is [open source](https://github.com/open-resource-discovery/specification) an can be used by SAP partners and customers if they see a value in adopting it, like better integration in the SAP ecosystem
  - The specification is open for extensions via labels, custom types, spec extensions. Those don't need to go through alignment first.

<h3>Non-Goals</h3>
</div><div className="card__body"><p>

- Replace industry-standard resource definition formats like OpenAPI
- Describing resources or capabilities in extensive detail.
- Currently it is not recommended to put fast changing information into ORD, as the current pull-based transport mechanism would be to slow and expensive to support time-critical updates.
  - This could change in the future by introducing more efficient, asynchronous transport modes.
- Currently: Describe resources other than those that are owned and exposed by the systems directly
  (only self-description of systems).
  - This could be changed in the future if necessary.

## Future Plans

Now that ORD is [open-source](https://open-resource-discovery.github.io/specification/) and a neutrally governed standard via [Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/), a next step is to work with partners to establish it as an industry wide standard.
We are also part of the publicly funded [IPCEI CIS](https://www.bmwk.de/Redaktion/EN/Artikel/Industry/ipcei-cis.html) / [ApeiroRA](https://apeirora.eu/) project, where we work towards this goal.

The specification itself is designed to be generic, so most SAP specific aspects are described as [spec extensions](./spec-extensions).
Some concepts like [namespaces](./spec-v1/#namespaces) could be further standardized if there's a need for cross-company metadata exchange.
